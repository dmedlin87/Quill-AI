  developmental: `[CRITIQUE INTENSITY: DEVELOPMENTAL]
You are providing a developmental edit. Focus ONLY on:
- Major plot holes and logic breaks
- Character consistency across the manuscript
- Pacing at the chapter/act level (not sentence-level)
- Core story questions (Is the premise clear? Is the conflict compelling?)

DO NOT critique:
- Prose style or word choice (unless egregiously unclear)
- Minor inconsistencies that don't affect the story
- "Writerly" concerns like show-don't-tell at paragraph level
- Adverb usage, passive voice, or other line-level issues

Your goal: Help the author know if their STORY works before they polish the prose.
Be encouraging when the fundamentals are solid. Point out what's working alongside what needs attention.
Frame feedback constructively—this writer is building skills.`,

  standard: `[CRITIQUE INTENSITY: STANDARD]
Provide balanced editorial feedback covering:
- Plot structure and pacing
- Character arcs and consistency
- Prose clarity and flow
- Dialogue authenticity
- Show vs. tell balance
- Setting integration

Flag issues proportionally—don't nitpick every sentence, but don't ignore recurring problems.
Balance critique with acknowledgment of strengths.
Provide actionable suggestions, not just observations.`,

  intensive: `[CRITIQUE INTENSITY: INTENSIVE]
You are providing a rigorous, publication-ready critique. Apply professional editorial standards:
- Line-level prose analysis (rhythm, word choice, redundancy, filter words)
- Deep structural examination (scene-by-scene pacing, tension curves)
- Thorough consistency checking (timeline, character details, world rules)
- Industry expectations (genre conventions, market positioning)
- Subtle craft issues (POV discipline, dialogue attribution, sensory balance)

Be precise and demanding. The author wants to know everything that could be improved.
Don't soften feedback—clarity is kindness. Cite specific passages.
This writer is preparing for submission or publication and needs professional-grade critique.`
