## Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Source files scanned | 197 |
| Source files with tests | 195 (99.0%) |
| Source files missing tests | 2 |
| Potentially stale test files | 28 |
| Large files with low coverage | 0 |


## Source Files Missing Tests

### High Priority (>100 lines)

| File | Lines | Coverage |
|------|-------|----------|
| `features/debug/components/BrainActivityMonitor.tsx` | 177 | n/a |


### All Missing (2 files)

| File | Lines | Coverage |
|------|-------|----------|
| `features/debug/components/BrainActivityMonitor.tsx` | 177 | n/a |
| `features/settings/components/DeveloperModeToggle.tsx` | 33 | n/a |


## Potentially Stale Test Files

These test files don't have an obvious matching source file. They may be:

- Integration tests (expected)
- Tests for deleted code (should be removed)
- Tests with non-matching names (should be renamed)

|-----------|-----------------|
| `tests/App.test.tsx` | `*/App.ts(x)` |
| `tests/barrel-exports.test.ts` | `*/barrel-exports.ts(x)` |
| `tests/components/App.test.tsx` | `*/App.ts(x)` |
| `tests/config/index.test.ts` | `*/index.ts(x)` |

## How to Use This Report

1. **High Priority Missing Tests**: Focus on files >100 lines first
2. **Stale Tests**: Review and remove tests for deleted code
3. **Large Low-Coverage Files**: These are your biggest risk areas

### Running the Audit

```bash
npm run test:audit
```
