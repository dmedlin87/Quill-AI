# Bug FDocumentation edits
“For non‑generated docs, verify any file paths, tool names, and APIs against the code before changing text.”
“Prefer short, code‑anchored checklists and links over duplicating implementation details in prose.”
Auto‑generated docs
“Never hand‑edit auto‑generated docs (e.g. docs/TEST_COVERAGE.md, docs/TEST_AUDIT.md); only update via their scripts.”ixes

- Always run code to verify fixes. Never claim something works based on reading alone.
- For non-trivial bugs, write a failing test first, then fix, then confirm the test passes.
- Keep reproduction tests as regression coverage unless redundant.
