# Plan

1. Review AppBrainContext.tsx and EditorContext.tsx plus existing tests to identify coverage gaps. **(In Progress)**
2. Add or update tests to cover missing behaviors and edge cases for both contexts.
3. Run targeted Vitest suites for AppBrainContext and EditorContext and summarize results.
