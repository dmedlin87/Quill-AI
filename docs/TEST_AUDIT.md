## Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Source files scanned | 233 |
| Source files with tests | 232 (99.6%) |
| Source files missing tests | 1 |
| Potentially stale test files | 21 |
| Large files with low coverage | 0 |


## Source Files Missing Tests

### High Priority (>100 lines)

| File | Lines | Coverage |
|------|-------|----------|
| `features/analysis/components/ShadowReaderPanel.tsx` | 166 | n/a |


### All Missing (1 files)

| File | Lines | Coverage |
|------|-------|----------|
| `features/analysis/components/ShadowReaderPanel.tsx` | 166 | n/a |


## Potentially Stale Test Files

These test files don't have an obvious matching source file. They may be:

- Integration tests (expected)
- Tests for deleted code (should be removed)
- Tests with non-matching names (should be renamed)

| Test File | Expected Source |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `tests/factories/analysisResultFactory.test.ts` | `*/analysisResultFactory.ts(x)` |
| `tests/features/agent/index.test.ts` | `*/index.ts(x)` |
| `tests/features/analysis/index.test.ts` | `*/index.ts(x)` |
| `tests/features/analysis/ShadowReader.test.tsx` | `*/ShadowReader.ts(x)` |
| `tests/features/core/index.test.ts` | `*/index.ts(x)` |

## How to Use This Report

1. **High Priority Missing Tests**: Focus on files >100 lines first
2. **Stale Tests**: Review and remove tests for deleted code
3. **Large Low-Coverage Files**: These are your biggest risk areas

### Running the Audit

```bash
npm run test:audit
```
