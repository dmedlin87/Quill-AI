## 2024-12-12 - Form Accessibility Patterns
**Learning:** Adding explicit visual indicators for required fields (like a red asterisk) is better than relying on the browser's default validation UI or `required` attribute alone, as it sets expectations before interaction. Also, using `aria-describedby` to link helper text to inputs is crucial for screen readers, as the "placeholder" attribute is often not announced or confused with the label.
**Action:** In future form components, always include a `helperText` prop and a `required` visual indicator prop/check, and ensure they are programmatically associated with the input.
