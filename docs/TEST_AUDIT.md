## Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Source files scanned | 187 |
| Source files with tests | 187 (100.0%) |
| Source files missing tests | 0 |
| Potentially stale test files | 23 |
| Large files with low coverage | 0 |


## Potentially Stale Test Files

These test files don't have an obvious matching source file. They may be:

- Integration tests (expected)
- Tests for deleted code (should be removed)
- Tests with non-matching names (should be renamed)

## How to Use This Report

1. **High Priority Missing Tests**: Focus on files >100 lines first
2. **Stale Tests**: Review and remove tests for deleted code
3. **Large Low-Coverage Files**: These are your biggest risk areas

### Running the Audit

```bash
npm run test:audit
```
