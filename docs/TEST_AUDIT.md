## Potentially Stale Test Files

These test files don't have an obvious matching source file. They may be:

- Integration tests (expected)
- Tests for deleted code (should be removed)
- Tests with non-matching names (should be renamed)

| Test File | Expected Source |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `tests/App.test.tsx` | `*/App.ts(x)` |
| `tests/barrel-exports.test.ts` | `*/barrel-exports.ts(x)` |
| `tests/components/App.test.tsx` | `*/App.ts(x)` |
| `tests/config/index.test.ts` | `*/index.ts(x)` |
| `tests/factories/analysisResultFactory.test.ts` | `*/analysisResultFactory.ts(x)` |

## How to Use This Report

1. **High Priority Missing Tests**: Focus on files >100 lines first
2. **Stale Tests**: Review and remove tests for deleted code
3. **Large Low-Coverage Files**: These are your biggest risk areas

### Running the Audit

```bash
npm run test:audit
```
