## Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Source files scanned | 224 |
| Source files with tests | 224 (100.0%) |
| Source files missing tests | 0 |
| Potentially stale test files | 7 |
| Large files with low coverage | 0 |


## Potentially Stale Test Files

These test files don't have an obvious matching source file. They may be:

- Integration tests (expected)
- Tests for deleted code (should be removed)
- Tests with non-matching names (should be renamed)

| Test File | Expected Source |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `tests/helpers/testUtils.test.ts` | `*/testUtils.ts(x)` |
| `tests/mocks/geminiClient.test.ts` | `*/geminiClient.ts(x)` |
| `tests/mocks/testFactories.test.ts` | `*/testFactories.ts(x)` |
| `tests/services/intelligence/chunkManager_coverage.test.ts` | `*/chunkManager_coverage.ts(x)` |
| `tests/services/intelligence/entityExtractor_coverage.test.ts` | `*/entityExtractor_coverage.ts(x)` |
| `tests/services/intelligence/index_coverage.test.ts` | `*/index_coverage.ts(x)` |
| `tests/services/intelligence/structuralParser_coverage.test.ts` | `*/structuralParser_coverage.ts(x)` |

## How to Use This Report

1. **High Priority Missing Tests**: Focus on files >100 lines first
2. **Stale Tests**: Review and remove tests for deleted code
3. **Large Low-Coverage Files**: These are your biggest risk areas

### Running the Audit

```bash
npm run test:audit
```
